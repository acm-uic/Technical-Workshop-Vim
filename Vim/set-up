/////SET-UP/////

On UIC CS lab computers or MacOS:
1. Open up the terminal.
2. Type in "ssh <Your_NetID>@systems3.cs.uic.edu".
3. Enter your password. 


On Windows:
1. Download and install a SSH client. The one that's probably easiest to use is OpenSSH. Install the OpenSSH CLIENT here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=powershell#install-openssh-for-windows. 
2. Once installed, set up a connection by typing into the connection address "ssh <Your_NetID>@systems3.cs.uic.edu".
3. Once the terminal opens, enter your UIC password.
4. Type "yes" and hit Enter.
